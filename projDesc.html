                          <p>Mainstream grocery shopping damages our ecosystem through packaging waste from cans, glass, cardboard, and plastic. Shoppers who are interested in reducing their environmental impact and would like to do package-free shopping lack detailed information such as product and price listings of loose products that are available in their neighborhood. These shoppers need a tool that provides relevant and accessible information to make sustainable shopping less intimidating.</p>
